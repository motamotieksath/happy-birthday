        <u>Subject:</u> Best wishes for your 22nd birthday, with annotations.<br><br>
        <u>Attached:</u> An online album<br>
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        Please be informed that I, Abhinav Ashutosh (laldasji) have decided to convey my best wishes for this day in the required form, that is, a letter. The mode of conveyance was supposed to be different, however, given the assumption that the message would be a letter, that’s what it’s going to be this time. To add a cherry on top, it has been decided that this letter would be in as formal a fashion as possible. Another note to add would be that the addressal has been made based on the person I’m referring to while writing this letter, which is not the actual person, but the person in my mind, given this letter is not of a “finish-and-send” manner. Also, given that I’ve received a few feedbacks regarding your friends wanting to know more about me, this letter is going to be written in a “friend-friendly” manner, where nothing embarrassing is going to be detailed upon (not even the time you fell INTO the table, which is entirely different from what it sounds like), such that other people are able to read it as well, if willing.<br>
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        First of all, I would like to convey my happiness. Even though with said tone of the letter it might not seem to be much, I must emphasise that the tone has nothing to do with my actual emotions on the subject. The first thought that comes to mind when thinking about today is that you have grown. This is not a play on words and does not contain any sexual innuendo, although truth be told I’d very much say the same thing even if the reference was the latter. Please note that I am getting slightly aroused thinking about the same, but I believe this is of little to no relevance, so elaboration on this topic is to cease immediately. I digress.<br>
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        I would also take this opportunity to apologise for the mishap due to which the entire letter was purged from the repository a few weeks ago. I haven't been able to recover it but I assure you that I will replicate its contents to the best of my knowledge, which is not much, considering the duration across which writing that letter was spread.<br>
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        I’ve known you since you were an unable-to-consent child (according to the POCSO act, if I’m not wrong), but so was I, you and I being 17 years 1 month and 16 years 11 months old respectively. It could be argued that you conspired to have the both of us together, given that you became a consenting adult before I did, and hence what you did accounts to a criminal conspiracy, but I’m not here to argue about that since I’m not a lawyer. Nevertheless, as of today you’re 22 years old, and I am 21 years and 9 months old, implying that the two of us have known each other for about 5 years. These 5 years have been a rollercoaster ride, with drama as much as that in an entire bigg boss season, with love more than that in a PG rated romance series, and situations which can be compiled into an entire bollywood movie. My one hope is that this one has a happy ending unlike some other movies I can think of, the other hope being no one prosecutes you with the above mentioned crimes and allegations (please note that the above statement means anyone apart from the writer).<br>
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        Despite whatever situations we have faced, the both of us have had an unwavering support for each other, through times tough and easy. Please also note that we’ve spent almost 23% of our lives knowing each other, which is almost 1/4th of our entire lives (I understand fully well that you did not want to participate in any calculation in any form, hence I’ve simplified it for you). The quotes inside the parentheses are not meant to insult you, but to point out an implicit reality, which one could argue was better left unsaid, but according to me was important to be pointed out. Regardless of whatever situations we have faced, the previous year has been a very smooth sailing journey compared to the years before, and I strongly feel that we’ve never been closer than we are now, on account of fewer fights, fewer disagreements which have led to a temporary drift, and better communication. My love for you has grown two folds over the last year, for reasons I cannot understand, but I do have a few guesses (vashikaran, tantric kriya, etc.). This might not seem like a lot, but it’s a 100% increase in love (Again, I know you don’t want anything to do with numbers, hence the simplification). Consequently, this has also made me more possessive of you and sensitive to you, something I hope you understand.<br>
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        The crux of the three paragraphs above is simply that I love you, and I would prefer to see more of you in the future (understanding of this sentence has been entirely left to the reader, every conceivable meaning is correct). I would also like to take that number from 23% (mentioned above) to 90% (I want to be with you for a total of 150+ years, or about 150 years from now (I saved you some calculation again)). And in the unfortunate event of either one of us passing, we haunt each other in a spectral form (preferred over an invisible & untouchable form) till the other one dies. I consent for you to do so, and demand your consent for the same.<br>
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        I sincerely wish that we were together on this day when we mark your escape from the uteral prison you were contained in. I would like to thank the doctor that freed you from said prison, and your parents who decided that you be brought to existence, and later decided to keep you alive by whatever means deemed necessary. I would also like to thank you for being with me and making my life partially amazing. The reader must note that my life would’ve been fully amazing had the subject not been such an annoyance in everyday life. Life without you would’ve been a life without a rollercoaster of senseless and uncalled for comments, jokes, and insults. Some might argue that the above mentioned life is a life well lived, but I must be the first one to admit that it misses something crucial, the phenomenon which is colloquially known as the “X-factor” (Not to be confused with the “XXX-factor”, although the writer yearns for both). Without the X-factor, life is most enjoyable, but not completely, missing some aspects of enjoyment which otherwise cannot be found. Some analogies would include<br>
        <ul>
            <li>Pizza without ketchup (you)</li>
            <li>Popeye’s veg burger without the onion rings (me)</li>
            <li>College without bunking classes (the both of us)</li>
            <li>Faeces without flies flying around (only you, as per my sources)</li>
        </ul><br><br>
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        Thinking about the fact that this birthday is going to be one of those where we do not meet makes me sad, given that we were unable to meet on your 21st birthday as well. Therefore, I would like to ask you to keep me updated with all the happenings of the day, as if I am there with you. And I mean everything (I don’t believe I need to further elaborate on this statement, given the history of my demands). I would also like to play badminton with you and beat you, again. (The former sentence is completely random and does not match the tone nor the context of the paragraph, however, the writer believes it to be crucial that he remains honest and upfront with the reader. Additionally, the outcome of the previous badminton match with the writer is not up for debate).<br>
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        Now I would like to say a few lines in your language of preference, which are going to contain the maximum amount of emotion I have displayed in this concise letter. The formatting of these lines would be done in such a way as to draw attention to it and not be skipped, unlike what happened last year (the reason for this letter being much better formatted than the previous one).<br>
    </p>

    <br>
    <p>
        This poem, which is the amalgamation of peak human creativity along with all the emotions a human heart can contain, depicts my undying love for you in ways no one but the two of us can understand.<br>
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        Also, I was reminded of some of the plans we used to have when we used to celebrate your birthday together, and it does not bring me any joy to realise that it is not going to be possible this year as it wasn’t in the previous. In addition to that, celebrating your 23rd birthday would be hard, considering my relocation as a possibility due to getting a job. Nevertheless, my efforts to make your birthday a special event are going to be present in one way or the other. I’m thinking of ways we can make it happen even though you might be far away from where I would be, solutions involving taking a leave, to flying you here and then back, if it is a possibility. Even though it might be a bit hard (pun not intended), I will do everything that’s in my power to be with you on that day, if meeting and celebration is a possibility. Again, as of me writing this letter, I'm reminded of the celebration of your 20th birthday, which I will argue was the best birthday celebration you’ve had till date, and just like the outcome of the badminton match, it’s not up for debate. However, it would please me if you would share the moments of your 20th birthday which you enjoyed the most (not here, in direct messages).<br>
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        Lastly, I’d like to bring attention to the fact that this is a formal letter, so it’s not going to have any post scripts. The mention of this fact is going to bring out a desire in you that this letter should have one, but I’m not going to comply with it, for the above mentioned reason. Since today (the day you’re reading this letter) is Sunday, I’m looking forward to meeting you whenever you’re available next. Please also note that the last time I wrote to you on your birthday, I could not go through with keeping it formal till the end, but as you can see, it has remained quite plain and bland as a formal letter is expected to be, although the annotations might not have kept it formal to my liking.<br>
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        I’d also like to request you to enjoy this day to the fullest of your capacity, without giving me the fear of missing out and updating me about your day as frequently as possible. Wishing you the very best for the future. I have also tried my best to not add anything “NSFW” to the letter. I hope my efforts were appreciated. I wish this letter finds you before I do (Is this a threat? Is this the writer missing you? No one knows). Any feedback regarding the letter is appreciated and entertained. I wish you the very best wishes for the upcoming festival of lights. Happy Diwali!<br>
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        Yours Sincerely,<br>
        Laldasji.<br>
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        ...
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        If I ever build a time machine, the first thing I’ll do is to set the past in a way that we meet sooner.
        I love you. You give me hope, and you make me strong. Thank you for being a part of my life. I love you so much. Happy birthday! Your next birthday is going to be on a Monday, and I hope that we're able to meet then, after not being together on your birthday for two years.<br>
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        I believe that we’ve grown together, and grown into each other, and I wouldn't change that for anything in the world, except, maybe, when we have children, <b>FOUR of them, just as WE planned.</b><br>
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        And then maybe we could grow old together, as I give you letters each year on your birthday as I have been doing, and rub foot cream on your bunions because they hurt from the excessive shoe wearing you did when you were younger, and I used to constantly be at your neck about it, but you didn’t listen, just as you don’t know. Silly, silly you.<br>
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        Also I sincerely apoligise for the lack of content this time, and even though I’ve outdone my self from the previous time I would’ve done much better had the previous repository not been deleted, since it also contained one other attachment, apart from our album, but no point talking about what's lost. I hope you liked the letter and the present, both of which I created with my very own hands (and a computer, obviously).<br>
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        Sometimes I get very angry at you, when you don't talk to me, but then my mind goes: I get angry at you because I love you, so is that even anger? Whatever be the case, sometimes you do piss the hell out of me. I thought I'd write more but I've recalled how much you've started to annoy me lately, so that’s it from my side. I'll see you tommorrow and hopefully you don't make me as angry as you do.<br>
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        I just realised that I’m not talking to you, I’m talking to image of you that I have in my mind... hmm... something to think about isn't it? Anyway <b>FUCK YOU</b>, literally and figuratively, for making me angry (and sometimes aroused). I wish I could explain to you how much I love you, and whenever I get off any electronic device and start thinking by slightest, I think of you and how much I love you and how much you love me and how good we'll be together.<br>
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        Today is a day before your birthday, 14/9/2024, and I am so excited but sad at the same time because I won’t be able to celebrate your birthday wiith you. I hope you have a great day tomorrow, without any fights or disagreements with your family, because these days are the ones when everyone is quite sensitive to these things. I don’t know what your reaction will be as you read this portion of the letter with a background image of you just getting out of a shower, you might be happy or just not be bothered, I don’t know! Whatever be the case, I find these images of you to be pretty cute, the reason why they're the background images hehe. I mist admit that you’re very pretty and very cute, and even though I might not say this as often as I would like to, I’d prefer to keep it this way, otherwise sar pe chadh jaogi tum.<br>
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        Yours (but angry because you annoy me too much nowadays),<br>
        Abhinav Ashutosh<br>
        Byebye!<br>
        Muuaaahhhh 🤗💗💕🩷💖💋<br>
        <br>
        All the best for the next year, until 23:59, September 14, 2025 (Uske baad ke liye best wishes alag se letter mein milenge).The letter was pretty clean wasn’t it? (in terms of NSFW stuff, unlike the previous one)<br>
